        Buy Servus, Pick Your Price

        Hello, my name is Carlo Zottmann.  I am a freelance developer, 39
        years old and married.  I invest a lot of time, care and energy in
        Servus, and I'd like to be able to support it in 1, 2 or 3 years time.

        Don't get me wrong, please: this isn't about pity or haggling.
        %a{ :href => "#read-more" }
          It's about freedom and fairness.

          Here's the thing: pricing software right is really, really hard.
          When I'm trying to find the right price for my applications, my
          personal formula is this:

        %p
          %i.formula (price I would pay for something like it) / 2

        %p
          Back when I opened my store I knew I would pay ~$20 for a tool
          like Servus, hence I set
          %strong the price
          to
          %strong €8 / $10.

        %p
          But, frankly, I don't sell as many copies as I'd like.&nbsp;:)  Maybe
          Servus is scratching an itch other people simply don't feel, it's
          possible.  Or maybe I am overvaluing what I've built, also
          possible.

        %p
          So I asked some of my customers for their honest opinion.
          Some told me Servus is too cheap.  Then there are those who think
          the price just right.  And a few said it's too expensive.  Hooray!
          Back to square #1.

        %p
          %i
            (BTW, for the record, the free market fairies are insane: for
            most developers, selling apps at €0.79 / $0.99 a pop and hoping
            for lots of customers is
            %strong not
            a sound long-term strategy.  Who would've thought?)

        %p
          But all that market research slash guessing drives me crazy.  I'll
          probably never find the right price on my own, as I find that part
          of business quite exhausting.  I'd rather spend that time on
          building something solid and on implementing all the good
          stuff on my
          %i "useful new features"
          list.

        %p
          So I'm going to pass that decision-making on to you.  :)

          Please think about what Servus is worth
          = succeed "," do
            %em to you
          then pick a fair price.

      %p
        Thank you!  :)
