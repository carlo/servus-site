          Here's the thing: pricing software is really, really hard.  When I'm
          trying to find the right price for my applications, my personal
          formula is this:

        %p
          %i.formula ( price I would pay for a tool like this ) &times; 0.5

        %p
          So back when I opened my store I knew I would pay ~$20 for a tool
          like Servus, hence
          %strong the price should be €8 / $10.

        %p
          But, frankly, I don't sell as many copies as I'd like.  :)  Maybe
          Servus is scratching an itch other people simply don't feel, it's
          possible.  Or maybe I am overvaluing what I've built, also
          possible.

        %p
          So I asked some of my customers for their honest opinion.
          Some told me Servus is too cheap.  A few said it's too expensive.
          Also there are those who think the the price just right.  Hooray!
          Back to square #1.

        %p
          But the guessing drives me crazy.  I'll probably never find the
          right price on my own; and for the record, the free market fairies
          are insane.
          %i
            (Selling their apps at €0.79 / $0.99 a pop is not a sound
            long-term strategy for most developers.  Who would've thought?)

        %p
          %strong So.

          Please think about what Servus is worth to you, then pick a fair
          price.
