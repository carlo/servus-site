        Can I buy Servus on the Mac App Store?

      %p
        Short answer: Not at the moment.  Maybe in the future; I won't
        rule it out.

      %p
        Long answer: during the development of Servus I've submitted the
        app to the Mac App Store with the plan of selling it there.  The
        review process was a) not very transparent and b) taking way too
        long for my taste.  During the third round of review submissions
        I kind of lost interest in potentially going through all that
        hassle for every single update I would post in the future.

      %p
        It might return at some point down the road, it's entirely
        possible.

      %h2#q-license-terms
        What are the license terms?

      %p
        Each license is valid for all Macs the license holder personally
        owns and is the primary user of.  If you yourself have three Macs,
        one license is enough.  If you have two Macs and your spouse has
        one, and you both want to use Servus, you'll need two licenses.

      %p
        If you have a company and technically "own" 500 Macs, I'd
        appreciate it if you would buy more than just one license, tho.
        ;)


    %section
      %h2#q-wot
        I don't understand what this app does.  Why do you suck at
        explaining?

      %p
        It's a congenital thing.  Anyways:

      %ol
        %li
          You have a file, you'd like to send that file to someone, but
          you want to have that file embedded in some sort of preview page.
        %li
          You drop the file on Servus' menubar icon.
        %li
          Servus uploads your file to your Dropbox account.
        %li
          Servus builds a preview page for your file and uploads that, too.
        %li
          The link to the preview page is copied to your clipboard.

      %p
        Step 4 will either use Servus' built-in preview page theme, or you
        can use your own templates for that.
      %p
        Does that help?  :)


    %section
      %h2#q-scripting
        Does Servus have scripting support?

      %p
        Yes, it does.  When the app is running it is listening for URLs
        with the scheme
        %code servus://
        — to trigger an upload you'd call
        %code servus://upload/[absolute&nbsp;filepath]
        \.  From your Terminal, you could do a
        %code open&nbsp;servus://upload/Users/carlo/Desktop/important.txt
        , from AppleScript you'd run
        %code tell&nbsp;application&nbsp;"Finder"&nbsp;to&nbsp;open&nbsp;location&nbsp;servus://upload/…
        \.


    %section
      %h2#q-theme-docs
        Where can I find documentation on how to create my own preview
        page themes?

      %p
        %a{ :href => "/theme-docs" } Look here.


    %section
      %h2#q-theme-selling
        I've created a custom theme for Servus, and it's great.  May I
        sell it?

      %p
        Yes, please!  Servus needs nice themes… lots of them!  Let me
        know if you created one.


    %section
      %h2#q-selling-pointers
        I'd like to sell my custom themes, but I have no idea how.  Any
        pointers?

      %p
        I've heard good things about
        %a{ :href => "https://creativemarket.com/" } Creative Market
        and had good experiences with
        %a{ :href => "https://gumroad.com/" } Gumroad.
        Both are super-simple to set up, you don't have to pay anything up
        front (they work on a commission basis), and they keep the scary
        payment stuff away from you.  And no, I don't get any kickbacks
        for telling you.  :)

      %p
        Just make sure to give me a shout when you're up and running,
        please!


    %section
      %h2#q-bug-dropping
        The menubar icon doesn't accept my dropped files, nothing happens.
        What is wrong?

      %p
        Apologies: you've come across a somewhat elusive bug that occurs
        only for some people — they have to click the menubar icon before
        it accepts drops again.  I'm aware of the issue but have a really
        hard time reproducing it.  I'm working on it!

      %p
        Try clicking the menubar icon once (or restarting the app), and
        then try again, that usually does the trick.


    %section
      %h2#q-cancel-uploads
        Is there a way to cancel a large upload in progress?

      %p
        Not yet, no.  Sorry.  That's a feature on my todo list, tho.


    %section
      %h2#q-tracking
        Do you track what I am sharing?

      %p
        No.  Mostly because a) what you upload is your own business and
        b) I really don't care.


    %section
      %h2#q-dropbox-path
        Where are my uploads/shares stored?

      %p
        In your Dropbox, in folder

        \.


    %section
      %h2#q-logs
