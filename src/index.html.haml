        What it is

      %p
        It's a menubar icon.  Drop a file onto it, and the file will be
        embedded in a nice
        %strong preview page,
        then both are uploaded to
        %strong your Dropbox.
        Once done, the link is copied to your clipboard.

      %p
        Servus comes with a
        %a{ :href => "https://dl.dropbox.com/s/vqlos2avs6fp6x8/index.html" } clean built-in preview page theme
        but you can create
        %strong your own custom themes, too.

        Why it exists

      %p
        I created Servus because I'm a freelancer myself.  Quite often I need
        to send files to my clients.  I feel that embedding those files in
        %strong a preview page of my own brand
        makes for a more professional appearance.

        The
