          What is the maximum file size for the things I can share with Servus?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The size of the files you share is only restricted by the size of
          your Dropbox account.  If your account has 1.5GB free space left,
          then that's your upper file size limit.

        <h3>
          Can I buy Servus on the Mac App Store?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Short answer: Not at the moment.  Maybe in the future; I won't
          rule it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long answer: during the development of Servus I've submitted the
          app to the Mac App Store with the plan of selling it there.  The
          review process was a) not very transparent and b) taking way too
          long for my taste.  During the third round of review submissions
          I kind of lost interest in potentially going through all that
          hassle for every single update I would post in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might return at some point down the road, it's entirely
          possible.

        <h3>
          What are the license terms?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Each license is valid for all Macs the license holder personally
          owns and is the primary user of.  If you yourself have three Macs,
          one license is enough.  If you have two Macs and your spouse has
          one, and you both want to use Servus, you'll need two licenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a company and technically "own" 500 Macs, I'd
          appreciate it if you would buy more than just one license, tho.
          ;)

          I don't understand what this app does.  Why do you suck at
          explaining?
        </h3>
        <p>
          It's a congenital thing.  Anyways:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You have a file, you'd like to send that file to someone, but
            you want to have that file embedded in some sort of preview page.
          </li>
          <li>
            You drop the file on Servus' menubar icon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Servus uploads your file to your Dropbox account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Servus builds a preview page for your file and uploads that, too.
          </li>
          <li>
            The link to the preview page is copied to your clipboard.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Step 4 will either use Servus' built-in preview page theme, or you
          can use your own templates for that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does that help?  :)

          Both are super-simple to set up, you don't have to pay anything up
          front (they work on a commission basis), and they keep the scary
          payment stuff away from you.  And no, I don't get any kickbacks
          for telling you.  :)

          The menubar icon doesn't accept my dropped files, nothing happens.
          What is wrong?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Apologies: you've come across a somewhat elusive bug that occurs
          only for some people — they have to click the menubar icon before
          it accepts drops again.  I'm aware of the issue but have a really
          hard time reproducing it.  I'm working on it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Try clicking the menubar icon once (or restarting the app), and
          then try again, that usually does the trick.
